# stillsuit configuration

stillsuit relies on a large, complex map as input. It's expected
that you will either store this file in EDN or generate it from
[catchpocket]().

## Input

stillsuit works by taking an existing lacinia schema definition file
and then adding a bunch of other definitions to it.

## Runtime overrides

You can override the configuration at runtime.
