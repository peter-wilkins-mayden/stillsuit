`stillsuit` is a library intended to be used with lacinia and datomic.

== Basic operation

The main interface to stillsuit is via the `(stillsuit/decorate)` function. This
function takes in a lacinia schema file, some maps referencing lacinia resolver
functions, and a configuration map. It returns a compiled lacinia file and an
application context; these parameters can be passed to `(lacinia/execute)` to
execute GraphQL queries.

In the diagram above, the library user supplies the bits in yellow and stillsuit provides the bits in green.

=== Sample code

Here's some sample code corresponding to the above diagram:

```clojure
(ns stillsuit-sample.seattle-manual
  (:require [com.walmartlabs.lacinia :as lacinia]
            [stillsuit.core :as stillsuit]
            [datomic.api :as d]))

;; Standard lacinia query definition
(def my-schema {:objects {...} :queries {:query_name {...}}})

;; Connection to datomic, which is added to the app context
(def datomic-conn (d/connect "datomic:dev://localhost:4334/seattle"))

;; Map of resolver names to resolver functions
(def my-resolvers {:resolver/name (fn [c a v] ...)})

;; Regular GraphQL query, ie from client code
(def my-query "{ query_name { field ... } }")

(defn -main [_]
  (let [;; This options map tells stillsuit where to look for stuff
        options   {:stillsuit/schema     my-schema
                   :stillsuit/config     {}
                   :stillsuit/connection (d/connect my-db-uri)
                   :stillsuit/resolvers  my-resolvers}
        ;; (stillsuit/decorate) is the main stillsuit interface.
        stillsuit (stillsuit/decorate options)
        ;; Stillsuit returns a compiled schema to the calling code
        compiled  (:stillsuit/schema stillsuit)
        ;; It also sets up an app context
        context   (:stillsuit/app-context stillsuit)
        ;; We pass these two values to (lacinia/execute) to resolve the query.
        result    (lacinia/execute compiled my-query nil context)]
    (println result)))
```

== What stillsuit provides

`(stillsuit/decorate)` adds a bunch of stuff to the configuration you provide to
it before returning lacinia input data.
