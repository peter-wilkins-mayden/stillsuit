stillsuit is a library that provides some facilities for
accessing [datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) datastores
from the [lacinia](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia)
GraphQL library.

It is designed to be used as a standalone library, but the
[catchpocket](https://github.com/workframers/catchpocket)
project can also be used in order to extract GraphQL
schema information from an existing datomic database.
